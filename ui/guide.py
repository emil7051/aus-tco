    ### What is Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?
    
    Total Cost of Ownership is a financial estimate that helps determine the direct and indirect costs of owning an asset over its entire lifecycle. For heavy vehicles, this includes:
    
    - **Initial costs**: Purchase price, registration, financing costs
    - **Operating costs**: Fuel/energy, maintenance, insurance, taxes
    - **End-of-life costs/values**: Residual value, disposal costs
    
    ### Why TCO Matters for Heavy Vehicles
    
    When comparing different vehicle typesâ€”particularly conventional diesel trucks versus battery electric trucksâ€”purchase price alone can be misleading:
    
    - Battery electric trucks typically have **higher upfront costs** but **lower operating costs**
    - Diesel trucks usually have **lower upfront costs** but **higher lifetime fuel and maintenance costs**
    
    A proper TCO analysis helps reveal the true economic comparison over the vehicle's lifetime.
    
    ### How to Use This Tool
    
    1. **Configure vehicles**: Set up the parameters for two vehicles you want to compare
    2. **Define operations**: Specify how the vehicles will be used (distance, days, etc.)
    3. **Set economic parameters**: Input discount rates, energy prices, etc.
    4. **Calculate TCO**: Generate comprehensive cost comparisons
    5. **Analyze results**: Examine breakdowns, charts, and payback periods
    
    ### Key Concepts to Understand
    
    - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Converts future costs to today's dollars using a discount rate
    - **Levelized Cost of Driving (LCOD)**: TCO divided by lifetime distance ($/km)
    - **Breakeven Point**: Year when cumulative costs of one vehicle become lower than the other

    ### Key Metrics to Focus On
    
    #### 1. Net Present Value (NPV) of TCO
    
    This is the sum of all costs over the vehicle's lifetime, discounted to present value using the discount rate.
    - **Lower NPV** means **lower total lifetime cost**
    - The discount rate significantly impacts this valueâ€”higher rates reduce the impact of future costs
    
    #### 2. Levelized Cost of Driving (LCOD)
    
    This is the TCO divided by the lifetime distance, expressed in dollars per kilometer ($/km).
    - Provides a normalized comparison between vehicles regardless of lifetime
    - Useful when comparing vehicles with different annual distances or lifespans
    
    #### 3. Breakeven Point
    
    The year when the cumulative costs of the initially more expensive vehicle become lower than the alternative.
    - Earlier breakeven points are favorable for the initially more expensive option
    - No breakeven point means the initially cheaper vehicle remains cheaper throughout the analysis period
    
    ### Reading the Charts
    
    #### Cumulative TCO Chart
    
    Shows how total costs accumulate over time for both vehicles.
    - The steeper the curve, the faster costs are accumulating
    - Look for when lines crossâ€”this is the breakeven point
    
    #### Annual Cost Breakdown
    
    Shows the cost components for each year of operation.
    - Financing costs are typically front-loaded
    - Energy and maintenance costs continue throughout the lifetime
    - Residual value appears as a negative cost in the final year
    
    #### Component Comparison
    
    Displays the relative contribution of different cost categories to the total TCO.
    - Helps identify which cost components drive the overall difference between vehicles
    - Useful for sensitivity analysisâ€”which parameters should you focus on optimizing?
    
    ### Making Decisions Based on Results
    
    When interpreting results, consider:
    
    1. **Investment horizon**: How long will you actually keep the vehicles?
    2. **Certainty of parameters**: Which inputs have the most uncertainty?
    3. **Cash flow implications**: Can you manage higher upfront costs for lower total TCO?
    4. **Non-financial factors**: Consider emissions, driver acceptance, noise, etc.
    5. **Sensitivity to key assumptions**: Try varying the most uncertain parameters
    
    ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: For fleet operators, it's often beneficial to test a small number of new technology vehicles before committing to fleet-wide adoption. This tool can help identify good candidates for pilot programs.
